# gatsby-json-pages-example

This site shows an example of how to generate pages in Gatsby from a json file. In this site, the data for pages is contained in `src/data.json`, and the template that renders the data is `templates/page.jsx`.

## Running

To run the example, clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
make develop
```

The pages specified in data.json are now accessible at `localhost:8000/page-1`, `localhost:8000/page-2`.
